# Adidas United States Sales Analysis

# 1: ASK

The goal of the Ask phase is to clearly define the business problem and transform it into actionable questions. This process includes understanding stakeholder objectives, identifying success criteria, and specifying key deliverables, all while considering constraints like time, resources, and data availability.

### 1.1: Define the Business Objective

The primary objective is to analyze the sales performance of Adidas products by examining factors such as sales trends, product popularity, regional performance, and profitability. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights that will help in optimizing product strategy, enhancing regional sales, improving marketing campaigns, boosting profitability, and supporting strategic decisions.

### 1.2: The Business Task
From my perspective, the rise and convenience of online shopping have become a significant trend among consumers. In this analysis, I will explore whether it would be beneficial for Adidas to close some physical stores and focus more on online sales. The main reason for this investigation is that e-commerce can significantly reduce operational costs. The key question is whether the available data supports the idea that increasing online sales would be a more profitable strategy for Adidas.
