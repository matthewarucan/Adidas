# Adidas United States Sales Analysis (In Progress)

# 1: ASK
The goal of the Ask phase is to clearly define the business problem and transform it into actionable questions. This process includes understanding stakeholder objectives, identifying success criteria, and specifying key deliverables, all while considering constraints like time, resources, and data availability.

### 1.1: Define the Business Objective
The primary objective is to analyze the sales performance of Adidas products by examining factors such as sales trends, product popularity, regional performance, and profitability. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights that will help in optimizing product strategy, enhancing regional sales, improving marketing campaigns, boosting profitability, and supporting strategic decisions.

### 1.2: The Business Task
From my perspective, the rise and convenience of online shopping have become significant trends among consumers. In this analysis, I will explore profitability and performance optimization for Adidas. My focus is on understanding what drives profit across different dimensions, such as sales channels, time periods, and geographic regions. Through this analysis, I aim to gain insights into whether increasing Adidas's e-commerce presence would be beneficial or if the current sales strategies are well-positioned for success.

### 1.3: Key Stakeholders

### 1.4: Guiding Questions
- What sales methods (e.g., online vs. in-store) are most effective for different products?
- How do sales trends fluctuate over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)?
- Which regions or states have the highest sales revenue and profit margins?

# 2: PREPARE
In the Prepare phase, we examine the data to assess its structure, credibility, and relevance for answering the business questions. This includes addressing potential limitations, verifying the data's integrity, and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.
